Struggling to learn, still....
I'm a programming novice, so can't really figure out what the heck is going on here.
But I'm trying. I still don't know why a carriage return gives me a new line in the editor, not in the file.
So aptly named. I didn't used to be stupid, but I feel that way now. Seriously, I'm in a foreign world. 
So I write new stuff, but am confused about how this branch gets back to the master.
